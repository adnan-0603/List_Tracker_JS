# To-do-list_project_JS:
this one is a vanilla javascript(plain javascript) project.I also used css for styling(such as body,header,container,fa-check(icon),li,select ,hover) and html for taking input in user interface.
In app.js ,the following code allows a user to give an input in the input box ,right after the input box it will be added as a todo-list.
On the other hand ,it allows user to delete an elemnet from the list .
it also uses a small  filter box ,where a user can select an item and this will find the similar item from to-do list,and only show the selected item from filter box ,if it does not matches with filter box's selected item ,it shows nothing.
